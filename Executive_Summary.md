## Executive Summary of Project 4: FEMA Lifelines Categorization for Disaster Response

As climate change rapidly alters the world we live in, governments and NGOs need to be prepared to quickly, efficiently, and effectively respond to any form of disaster. The chance to make a real difference in the lives of those experiencing the unthinkable is exactly why our team was so interested in working with New Light Technologies.

Difficulty in disaster response arises from the seemingly unscalable mountain of unique factors in each event. Geography, demographics, existing infrastructure, and more can all rapidly break down response strategies. We can witness this stark reality in our recent history. Over 1800 people died from Hurricane Katrina, a prime example of how misunderstanding the victims of a disaster and misallocating funds can turn a bad situation catastrophic. More recently, in Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria ravaged infrastructure to a degree where officials and NGO workers were struggling to get an understanding of what was damaged and what locations required resources. In both these examples, dangerous situations were misunderstood resulting loss of life and infrastructural damage which could have been avoided.

Fortunately, technology allows us to do quick situational analysis that gives us a complex understanding that in the past would have taken years to acquire. Using data collection processes, we can acquire hundreds of thousands of data points that can subsequently be fed into complex spatial mapping programs, powerful machine learning algorithms, and more. These data science tools get better every year, but have yet to be adopted by many organizations and world governments, and those that have adopted them are rarely using them to their full potential. Utilization of these tools can not only help us gains situational analysis, but also efficiently organize funds, direct workers to areas of needs, plan evacuation routes, and save lives.

Our team wanted to use FEMA lifelines (Safety and Security, Communications, Food/water/sheltering, Health and Medical, Hazardous Material, Energy) to create a toolset for better understanding and responding to disasters. For our use case example, we used the yelp API to create a dataset of Houston, Texas with a breadth of information about business/establishment listings. Combing this with Zillow datasets, census information, and an estimated damaged business dataset, we were able to form a comprehensive understanding of the city and the impact of Hurricane Harvey. With this data we were able to create illustrative visualization of where lifelines are in the city, a product which could be instrumental in the organization of resource allocation. In addition to this, combining findings about which areas are the hardest hit with our demographic data (language, age range, class) provided invaluable inferences about how to best help heavily damaged zip codes.

We believe it's important for Data Scientists to work with governments and organizations like New Light Technologies to put new scientific tools to action, saving lives and responding to disastrous situations as best as possible. This project shows an in depth use case of how exactly we can do this, and we believe it is in everyone's best interests that tools like these be given the funding and time they deserve to reach their fullest potential.
